A simple time management app
# Splatter-Brain

Help to remove barriers to studying and interrupted work flow cause by interactions with my mobile phone and social media. 
I am easily distracted by my phone; I find myself reaching for it every few minutes and I can get easily lost in the apps there. Focused learning becomes harder with distractions like social media on your phone, especially when it pings and vibrates with the latest COVID rules or employment update from my employer, USA storms,  USA fires, or other disasters. This year has been a time of great uncertainty and isolation so keeping up to date and engaged with friends, family, your job and news is important but I hope this app will allow people like me to better manage their focus learning time or just manage their phone and social media time
